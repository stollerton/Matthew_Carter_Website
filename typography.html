                    <h2>Typeface Designs</h2>
                    <p class="typographytext">Matthew Carter created many fonts and typefaces over the many years of his career. A good number of these fonts were designed to deal with specific technical difficulties, such as the limitations created by older computers back when they were the cutting edge in technology.</p>
                    <p class="typographytext">One font in particular, Charter, was designed specifically to use the least design elements possible in order to take up the smallest amount of computer memory. Another example of these early restrictions can be seen in the bold versions of Georgia and Verdana, which are so bold they appear almost black because they were created when computer screens were binary in nature and pixels were either black or white. Later in his career, some of Carterâ€™s earlier typefaces such as Georgia, Verdana, and Big Caslon, were digitized for use on more recent computers.</p>
