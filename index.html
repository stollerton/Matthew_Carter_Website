            <h2>A Man of Letters</h2>
            <p class="bodytext">Matthew Carter grew up in London, England with his father and mother. His father, Harry Carter, was a book designer and historian of printing, while his mother worked on scale drawings.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">“During a teenage stint in the Netherlands, he trained with an eccentric designer to cut typefaces by hand, a process that involves working at two or three removes from the final cast-metal product. Such training was unusual even at the turn of the 20th century, when machine-aided cutting was the norm, but Mr Carter counts it as invaluable” <small>(The Most-Read Man in the World, 2010)</small>.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">“Mr Carter sits near the pinnacle of an elite profession. No more than several thousand type designers ply the trade worldwide, only a few hundred earn their keep by it, and only several dozens—most of them dead—have their names on the lips of discerning aficionados. Then, there is Mr Carter” <small>(The Most-Read Man in the World, 2010)</small>.</p>
