                    <p class="newyorktext">Pursuing his new career, Matthew Carter travelled to New York to work, but returned to London and became a freelance designer later on. All the while he continued to hone his skills and create his own type. In 1961, he created his own version of the typeface Dante and worked on pieces for Heathrow Airport. Carter later was hired as a typographic advisor to a company called Crosfield Electronics. Crosfield Electronics was a company that specialized in the distribution of photon phototypesetting machines.</p>

                        <h2>Bitstream and Carter & Cone</h2>
                        <p class="bitstreamtext">Matthew Carter worked with many companies and clients, advising, designing, and developing typefaces. Carter designed typefaces for companies like the ITC, Bell, Mergenthaler Linotype, and IBM. However in 1981, Carter and his colleague, Mike Parker, created the type foundry, Bitstream Inc. Carter primarily worked designing typefaces at Bitstream, but sometimes had typefaces commissioned. “He and several colleagues opened Bitstream, a studio devoted exclusively to digital fonts, and set up shop at 215 First St. in East Cambridge. They chose the area, not far from MIT, to tap into the technical talent they needed to turn typefaces into font files for computers” <small>(Five things you should know about Matthew Carter, 2015)</small>. Carter left Bitstream in 1991 and eventually the company would be acquired by another company, Monotype in 2012.</p>
                        <p class="bitstreamtext">Matthew Carter co-created another type foundry company with Cherie Cone in 1992. The company was dubbed the Carter & Cone type foundry and worked to publish many typefaces created by Carter for the ITC, Font Bureau, Monotype, and others. “Most of his recent work was bespoke for Carter & Cone Type, the firm he operates with his partner Cherie Cone. His last personal endeavour, a set of 15 display and text faces called Miller, has become the single biggest royalty source among fonts to which he controls rights” <small>(The Most-Read Man in the World, 2010)</small>. Additionally Carter and Cone collaborated together to created designs specifically for companies like Microsoft. Matthew Carter is also a teacher in Yale University’s graphic design program. He began participating in Yale’s program in 1976 and has designed some corporate fonts for Yale.</p>
