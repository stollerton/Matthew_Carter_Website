                    <h2>Entry into the World of Type</h2>
                    <p class="typefoundrytext">His father gave Matthew Carter a window into the world of literature and history, and provided him with an opportunity before going to school at Oxford. Matthew Carter took an internship for a year at the Joh. Enschedé type foundry. “During a teenage stint in the Netherlands, he trained with an eccentric designer to cut typefaces by hand, a process that involves working at two or three removes from the final cast-metal product. Such training was unusual even at the turn of the 20th century, when machine-aided cutting was the norm, but Mr Carter counts it as invaluable” <small>(The Most-Read Man in the World, 2010)</small>.</p>

                        <h2>Joh. Enschedé Type Foundry</h2>
                        <p class="johtext">It was at the Joh. Enschedé type foundry that Carter was introduced to punchcutting. Punchcutting is a method where moulds were used to cast metal type and was considered a traditional approach used by artisans. Sadly the method was in decline long before the 1950’s and Carter considered himself lucky to be one of the last people in Europe to have been trained in the technique. He became enamoured with the experiences and skills he had during his time at the foundry and decided to move into a the graphic design and printing sector.  “I was supposed to start my studies of medieval English, but I decided I couldn’t face it. I expected to face a problem at home, because my father was a real academic, and had studied at the same Oxford college that had accepted me. To my surprise and relief my parents were really understanding” <small>(MyFonts: Creative Characters, 2013)</small>.</p>
                        <p class="johtext">The Joh. Enschedé type foundry was an extremely long lived company and had a rich history of printing and creating conservative typefaces for books and other mediums. “Most of the famous type designers of the first half of the 20th century were first and foremost either letterers or book designers. There were only a handful of individuals who made their living exclusively from designing type and, with the notable exception of Frederic W. Goudy, they all worked for type foundries” <small>(An Interview With Matthew Carter, 2011)</small>.</p>
